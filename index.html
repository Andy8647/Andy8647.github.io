  <h2>I am a programmer and a learner.</h2>
  <p>
    To be frank, I did not start learning programming very earily. Back to my
    high school, I just learned simple Visual Basic. After almost four years at
    UofT, although I have learned quite a number of CS courses, I still feel
    that I am somehow a beginner. There is always new technology and what we
    should do is keep rigorous, keep diligent, and keep learning.

    The following is an example of the JS library I have developped. This is a
    dynamic data visualization tool. The following example comapres the average
    GDP of five countries over the past decades. The data come from
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_largest_historical_GDP#cite_note-6"
      target="_blank"
      >Wiki</a
    >. You can check the library at
    <a href="https://dynrank.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">dyrank.js</a>.

    Although now I have finished my study at <i>University of Toronto</i>, I
    won't stop learning. In <a href="https://andy8647.com/blog/">my blog</a> I
    have post and will post my learning notes on Web devlopment, algorithms, and
    possibly Mathematics. Feel free to check out and leave a comment!

  <h2>I am a photographer.</h2>
  <p>
    Photography has been one of my hobbies since I was just a kid. I am
    interested in Humanistic and Landscape photography. The device I am using is
    a 10 years old Nikon D300s. Although it is old, it still works fine today.

  <h2>I am a gamer.</h2>
  <p>
    Although video game is a young baby comparing to other form of art like
    literature, I still firmly believe that video game is The Ninth Art. My
    favourite video games are <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>,
    <i>Super Smash Bros</i>, and <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i>.
    These games provided me with a fantastic way of experiencing a story or meet all my favourite characters together. This
    kind of experience is so unique that other form of arts like novel or movie
    could never provide. By this I do not mean that books or movies are worse
    than games. I also enjoy reading books and watching movies. The form of arts
    should be diverse and just like a old saying in Chinese: <i>There is no best writer, nor is there second best fighter (文无第一， 武无第二).</i>
