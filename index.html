		<h1>Hi there!</h1>
		<h1>My name is Andy Luo. </h1>

		<h2> I am a programmer. </h2>
		<p>
			To be frank, I did not start learning programming very earily.
			Back to my high school, I just learned simple Visual Basic.
			However, after almost four years at UofT, although I have learned
			quite a number of CS courses, I still feel that I am somehow a 
			beginner. There is always new technology and what we should do is 
			keep rigorous, keep diligent, and keep learning.

		<h2>I am a photographer.</h2>
		<p>
			Photography has been one of my hobbies since I was just 
			a kid. I am interested in Humanistic and Landscape 
			photography. The device I am using is a 10 years old 
			Nikon D300s. Although it is old, it still works fine today.
			Feel free to check my

		<h2>I am a gamer.</h2>
		<p>
			Although video game is a young baby comparing to other 
			form of art like literature, I still firmly believe 
			that video game is The Ninth Art. My favourite video game
			is <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>.
