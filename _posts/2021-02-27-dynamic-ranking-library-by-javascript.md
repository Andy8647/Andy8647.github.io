# DynamicRanking.js

This is a javascript library that allows developers to demonstrate the dynamic changing of rankings of some objects over time or other variables with a clear direction.

With this library, developers can demonstrate the comparision of some objects over time or some other naturally directional variable such as height within one graph. Developers can set the size of the graph, set it to be automatically playing or controlled by buttons which can be clicked by the users who is reading their website.

<div id="Ex1"></div>

The motivation is that lots of data that website
builders want to represent is related to some natrually directional variable, such as time and height etc.
This library will help build a histogram or pie chart or scatter plot dynamically changing over the natrually
directional variable.
Currently
there are many video tools to build such kind of dynamic data visualization into a video but there is a lack of
such tool for building on some website.
