### What is Flexbox?

" Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. " This is the introdction from *MDN Web Docs*. In my words, flexbox allows developpers to implement the lay out of items into columns or rows with higher efficiency and better compatibility acroos different platforms. Witnin a container, devloppers could arrange the layouts of items without knowing the size or with dynamic size. 

### Why Flexbox?

Comparing to traditional ways like table and float, the apperance of Flexbox saved the day of the web developpers. As I mentioned above, flexbox is more efficient. Once developpers set the parameters, the layout will automatically adapt to different reslution or size of the broswer window, which is similart to responsive layout. 

Anyway, Flexbox is strong and is a fundamental web technique nowadays. Let`s get started.

### How to use Flexbox?

#### Terminology

To utilize Flexbox, first we have to be familiar with its terminology.

</figure>

The first concept is that the items we want to demostrate are *flex items* and their container is *flex container*. In the css of flex container,
we have to set $$ \texttt{display: flex}$$ then we can go on. As mentioned above, we can display the flex items in rows or columns. Like Fig.1, the flex items are displayed in row directions. So the *main axis* is the row and *cross axis* is the column. This depends on the flex property:
$$\texttt{flex-direction}$$, which we will talk about later. For the other terminologies:
- main start/end: Flex items are layied out from main start to main end.
- main/cross size: The width/height of a flex item, depending on the main axis. In the case of Fig.1, the main size is width and the cross size is the height.

#### Properties

For flex container:
- $$\texttt{display: flex}$$: For the css of the container we have to make such set to enable the flexbox.
- $$\texttt{flex-direction}$$: 
  - $$\texttt{row}$$(default): the flex items will be placed from left to right
  - $$\texttt{row-reverse}$$: the flex items will be placed from right to left
  - $$\texttt{column}$$: the flex items will be placed from top to bottom
  - $$\texttt{column-reverse}$$: the flex items will be placed from bottom to top
  
- $$\texttt{flex-wrap}$$:
  - $$\texttt{nowrap}$$(default): all items will be on one line
  - $$\texttt{wrap}$$: if the container width is not enough to put all items on one line then the items will be placed on multiple lines from top to bottom
  - $$\texttt{wrap-reverse}$$: the items will be placed on mutiple lines from bottom to top

- $$\texttt{flex-flow}$$: abbreviation of $$\texttt{flex-direction}$$ and $$\texttt{flex-wrap}$$
 
<figure style="text-align: center">
    <img src="/assets/image/justify.png" class="pic" width="30%"/>
    <figcaption>Fig.2 Different valuse of justify-content</figcaption>
</figure>

- $$\texttt{justify-content}$$: define how items are placed along the main axis
  - $$\texttt{flex-start}$$(default): items will be aligned to the main start
  - $$\texttt{flex-end}$$: items will be aligned to the main end
  - $$\texttt{center}$$: items will be placed at the center of the main axis
  - $$\texttt{space-between}$$: first/last item will be placed on the main start/end, the others will be evenly distributed
  - $$\texttt{space-around}$$: items are evenly distributed and the space around the items are the same
  - $$\texttt{space-evenly}$$: items are evenly distributed and the space between any two items are the same
  - Note that the last two are similar but actually they are not the same. This requires more detailed study.
- $$\texttt{align-items}$$: define how items are placed along the cross axis
  - $$\texttt{strech}$$(default): items will be streched to fill the container along the cross axis
  - $$\texttt{flex-star/end}$$: items will be aligned to the cross start/end
  - $$\texttt{center}$$: items will be placed at the center of the cross axis
  - $$\texttt{baseline}$$:items are aligned such as their baselines align
- $$\texttt{align-content}$$: similar to $$\texttt{justify-content}$$, used when the container is wrapped

For flex itmes:
- $$\texttt{order: int}$$: 0 by default, larger order items will be placed after the ones with smaller order
- $$\texttt{flex-grow: int}$$: the proportion of the main size of this item in the main axis, define the ability for the item to grow
- $$\texttt{flex-shrink: int}$$: opposite to $$\texttt{flex-grow}$$, when the sum of the main size of the items are bigger than the width of the container, define how item shrink along the main axis
- $$\texttt{flex-basis}$$: $$\texttt{auto}$$ by default, define the default size of an element befire the remaining soace is distributed
- $$\texttt{flex:}$$ abbreviation of $$\texttt{flex-grow, flex-shrink}$$ and $$\texttt{flex-basis}$$. This could also be set in the container, in that case it will be applied to every item
- $$\texttt{align-self}$$: define how this item is placed along the cross axis
  
### Summary

The above are main properties of flexbox. Some of them should be more detailed, but at entry level this is enough for now. There is a small game
